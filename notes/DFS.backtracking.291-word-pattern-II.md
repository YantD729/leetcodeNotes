# 291. Word Pattern II

#dfs #medium #backtracking 

Given a pattern and a string s, return true if s matches the pattern.

A string s matches a pattern if there is some bijective mapping of single characters to non-empty strings such that if each character in pattern is replaced by the string it maps to, then the resulting string is s. A bijective mapping means that no two characters map to the same string, and no character maps to two different strings.
